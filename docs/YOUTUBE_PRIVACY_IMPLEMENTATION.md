- **Shadow**: Violet-tinted soft shadows
- **Typography**: Clean, modern with appropriate weights

### Component Structure
```typescript
<YouTubePrivacy
  videoId="VIDEO_ID"           // YouTube video ID or full URL
  title="Lesson Title"          // Optional: Display title
  duration="12:34"              // Optional: Video duration
  thumbnail="custom-thumb.jpg"  // Optional: Custom thumbnail
/>
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Video iframe only loads after user interaction
2. **Thumbnail Optimization**: Uses YouTube's CDN for thumbnails
3. **Minimal Re-renders**: State management optimized for performance
4. **CSS-in-JS**: Emotion styled components for optimal styling

## 📝 Usage Example

```typescript
import { YouTubePrivacy } from '@/components/cours/YouTubePrivacy';

// In your component
<YouTubePrivacy 
  videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  title="Introduction to Aurora50"
  duration="15:42"
/>
```

## 🔒 Privacy Benefits

1. **No tracking cookies** until user explicitly plays video
